# airline_safety_analysis

## According to studies, consumers will make their airline chocies based on knwoledge of previous incidents. They might think that airlines that have had incidents in the past are more riskly. In this analysis, we explore the validity of this thinking. In other words, should travelers avoid airlines that have had incidents in the past or is there something that is more indicative of risk? 

### Definition of Risk
We use the number of incidents in the past to derive an index for "risk", and normalize based on "available seat kilometer". Historically, US airlines have had the most reported incidents, largely driven by the high flight time. By normalizing the data based on how frequently airline fly, we get a better indication of risk per flight.
